### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an engineer with two years of experience in production. I have decided to change my career path, aiming to become a web developer. Although my previous experience does not directly involve this field, my interest in programming microprocessors has led me to pursue this path. Currently, I am actively developing skills in programming AVR microprocessors, and then I plan to expand my knowledge to STM32.
